### Go to Implementations CodeLens

A **Go to Implementations** link appears above every `interface` definition in your PHP files.

- **Clicking the link**:
    - If there is **one** implementation, you are taken directly to it.
    - If there are **multiple** implementations, a list appears for you to choose from.
    - If there are **no** implementations, a message appears in the status bar.

## Requirements

This extension requires a PHP project open in VS Code.
